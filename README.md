All assignments were coded in C++, and compiled with the g++ compiler.

Compliation information with example program hello.cpp Compilation Command: g++ hello.cpp or to name the output file a certain way: g++ hello.cpp -o hello.o

To execute the program, simply add the file name to the run argument, for example if your executable was named "hello.o" the way to run the algorithm on a dataset in the file "data.txt" would be:

Execution Instructions: ./hello.o data.txt
